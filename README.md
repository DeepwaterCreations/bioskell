# Bioskell
Bioinformatics in Haskell

I'm working through:

[Bioinformatics Algorithms: An Active Learning Approach, Phillip Compeau and Pavel Pevzner](http://bioinformaticsalgorithms.com/)

[Learn You a Haskell for Great Good!, Miran Lipovaƒça](http://learnyouahaskell.com/)

Instead of picking just one of them to focus on, like a sensible person would, I've decided to kill two birds with one stone and use what I learn about Haskell to write code for Bioinformatics. Because one might as well be an efficient autodidact, right?

This repository is for me to store whatever code I come up with during this exciting journey of excessive learning.
